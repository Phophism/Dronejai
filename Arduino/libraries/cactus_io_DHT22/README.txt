This is an Arduino library for the DHT22 temperature/humidity sensors. 

Rename the uncompressed folder cactus_io_DHT22. Check that the DHT folder contains cactus_io_DHT22.cpp and cactus_io_DHT22.h. Place the DHT library folder your <arduinosketchfolder>/libraries/ folder. You may need to create the libraries subfolder if its your first library. Restart the IDE.
